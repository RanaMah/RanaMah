## ðŸ’¬ About Me

I'm passionate about solving problems, writing clean code, and building my path toward becoming a software engineer.  
Currently focused on mastering data structures, algorithms, and building real-world projects.


## âš¡ Fun Fact

When Iâ€™m not solving LeetCode problems, youâ€™ll probably find me at the gym 
pushing limits both physical and mental. Fitness and coding are my two favorite ways to get stronger.
